This is a talk I gave at PDX.rb in April 2016.

This repository contains the slides (in `talk`), my `NOTES`, and a sample Rails app with RSepc tests to make sure I wasn't lying (in `src`).

To view the slides, first run `bundle install` in the top-level directory, then in `talk` run `showoff serve`.
